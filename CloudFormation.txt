What is AWS CloudFormation ? 

 1. AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you modal and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing
    those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS . 

 2. CloudFormation allows you to modal your infrastructure in a text file . You can use JSON or YAML to describe what resources 
    you want to create and configure .

 3. CloudFormation automates the provisioning, configuring, and updating of your infrastructure in a safe and controlled manner .
    There are no manual steps or controls that can lead to errors . 

 4. CloudFormation is available at no additional charge. You pay only for the AWS resources needed to run your applications . 

 5. CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you . You don't need to individually create 
    and configure AWS resources and figure what's dependent on what ; CloudFormation handels that . 

Core Concepts of AWS CloudFormation : 

1. AWS CloudFormation Template : 
    
    1. A CloudFormation template is a JSON or YAML formatted text file. You can save these files with any extension, such as 
       .yml, .json, .txt or .template . 

    2. An AWS CloudFormation template is a declaration of AWS resources that make up a 'Stack' . The template is stored as a 
       text file in either JSON or YAML format. Because they are just text files, you can create and edit them in any text editor 
       and manage them in your source control system with the rest of your source code . 
    
    3. CloudFormation uses these templates as blueprint for building your AWS resources .

    4. Whenever you create a stack, you also specify a template that CloudFormation uses to create whatever you described 
       in the template .
    
    5. You can also specify multiple resources in a single CloudFormation template and configure these resources 
       to work together .

2. AWS CloudFormation Stack : 

    1. A stack is a deployment of a CloudFormation template . You can create multiple stacks from a single CloudFormation 
       template .

    2. A stack contains a collection of resources that you can manage as a single unit . All the resources in a stack are defined 
       by the stack's AWS CloudFormation template . 
    
    3. AWS CloudFormation will create, update and delete a stack in its entirety : 
            1. If a stack cannot be created or updated in its entirety, AWS CloudFormation will roll it back, and automatically 
               delete any resources that were created . 
            2. If a resource cannot be deleted, any remaining reources are retained until the stack can be successfully deleted .
